## Yeoman Project Generator

I made this yeoman generator for initializing web application projects how I like them. It's meant for personal use. If you want to use it, use it. If you don't, then don't.

### Running the generator

Since the generator isn't published on npm, you'll have to clone the repository and then run
```bash
npm link
```
after which the generator can be used by running
```bash
yo project
```
